2009-Jul-14	weaver  Tag V01-00-00.  Consistent with pdsdata V00-05-00.  Added calibration
			cycles.  Added sequencing in the Evr (nevents or time).  Source levels
			now identify themselves by DetInfo to the ControlLevel during platform
			discovery.  Recorded transitions are broadcast (AllEvents, AllRecorders
			multicast group) to all nodes.
2009-Jul-13     cpo     Fix bug where AcqManager was putting the same task on the queue
                        when reconfiguring.
2009-Jul-10     cpo     Support for configuration of acqiris from database
2009-Jul-07	weaver  Fixed SysClk::sample rollover in VmonEb histos.  Fixed recorder level fixup
			that added contributions from all event levels.

			as a base for run control sequencer.

			Added function to drop evr multicasts and generate opal1k out-of-order (for testing).
			Fix in GenericPoolW to use counting semaphore for pool resource counting.
			Fix in Event Builder to keep good events in order.  Individual (errant) events can slip
			out-of-order due to dropped contributions and missing PulseId.
			Added support for vmon archiving.
2009-Apr-3      cpo     Change some default acqiris params so that
                        we don't get as many "WARNING: Parameter has been
                        adapted" messages.  We still have one, which
                        comes when we set the trigger coupling to DC50ohms
                        (for some reason it complains that the previous
                        setting didn't have the 50 ohms in it, I believe).

2009-Mar-31     weaver  Tag V00-08-00.  Consistent with pdsdata V00-03-00.
			Added missing versions to all data type constructions.
			Added typedefs in config/*Type.hh to track current versions of config objects.
			Added vmon.

2009-Mar-20	weaver	Tag V00-07-02.	Added collection "Query" messages for source
			level management.  Implemented partition id/multicast group
			assignments in management/[Source,Control]Level,PartitionMember and EvrManager.
2009-Mar-10	weaver	Tag V00-07-01.  Minor fixes to camera code.
2009-Mar-04	weaver	Tag V00-07-00.  Many changes to camera interfaces.  Now reads
			configuration from database and writes record on configure transition.
			Added a simple insert() to InDatagram class for appending data to
			an existing datagram.
2009-Feb-19	weaver  Added mon package for online monitoring support classes.
2009-Feb-13     cpo     Improved AcqManager, including out-of-synch detection
                        of dropped triggers.  EvgrManager now works at 360Hz
                        and sends down timestamps much like we expect the
                        MCC EVG to do.

2009-Jan-29	weaver	client/Fsm handles unmap/deallocate.  Added a default Sequeunce
			for L1 data that doesn't get one from an evr match.
2009-Jan-28	weaver	Tag V00-06-01.  zerocopy/dma_splice can now queue sparsely and
			share "release arguments" across many queued buffers.
			camera/DmaSplice,Frame,TwoDMoments added to support camera
			feature extraction.  xtc/PayloadIterator added; CDatagramIterator
			inherits from it.
2009-Jan-13	weaver	Tag V00-06-00.  Many changes to zero-copy eb including new
			dma_splice kernel module.
2008-Dec-19     cpo     Changes to evgr to support opcodes with rates
                        of 1,5,10,15,30,60,120,240Hz.  Also fix
                        for acqiris "Flags has been modified" warning and
                        bugs in Fsm.
2008-Nov-14     cpo     Tag V00-05-00.  Many changes to support exporting data to offline.

2008-Oct-27     cpo     Tag V00-03-01.  Forgot to add AcqServer files and
                        DmaEngine in utility.

			of zero-copy event builders.  Also added zerocopy/tub as
			a buffer between pipes.

2008-Sep-12	weaver	Initial import of utility, xtc, client, management code.
2008-Sep-09	weaver	Tag V00-00-00.  Initial import of service and collection code.
