2011-Sep-07 weaver	Added phase to ToEventWireScheduler,SegmentLevel.
2011-Apr-21 jackp	Added new version of cspad including ConfigV3
2011-Apr-12 weaver	Changed EbC to always keep a full select mask.  Segment levels typically
			don't have much buffering in front of the select, so the event-builder
			should read pending data as quickly as possible.
2011-Mar-31 weaver	Fixed recording of EncoderConfig.  Fixed 0.5s deadtime in AcqReader.  Added semaphore
			around Acqiris DMA routine calls to avoid driver bug that uses global mapping of
			DMA target memory pages.
2010-Dec-06 weaver	Tag V02-10-00.  Added software commands onto EvrDatagram.  Results in Command occurrence posted
			to segment-level appliance stream.  Changed Princeton to use new software command (rather than
			extra L1Accept) - only one readout mode now.
			Added sequencer to Evr configuration object (pdsdata/evr/ConfigV5).
			Sequencer can now be controlled by PartitionControl.
			Evr configuration object now describes EVR system configuration.  Each EVR parses its
			configuration from this object (using evgr/EvrCfgClient object).
			Added epicstools package for common channel access classes/methods.
2010-Nov-04 caf         Tag V02-08-05.  Inverted polarity of Opal trigger for newer cameras (FPGA firmware rev >= 1.20).
2010-Sep-20 weaver	Tag V02-08-00.  	
2010-Sep-7  weaver	Changes to get single-source timestamps: 
			  utility/ControEb,Transition, 
			  management/PartitionControl
			Added DataFileOpened occurrence type.
			Added broadcast mechanism to EpicsArchManager.
2010-Aug-11 caf  Added camsend flag --opalexp: integration time (0.01 - 320.00 ms, default frame period minus 0.1) (Opal only).
2010-Aug-10 weaver	Tag V02-06-00.  Added FEX algorithm to IpimbManager and non-default LusiDiagFex instance.
2010-Jun-08 weaver	Added separate a/b tap reference voltages for TM6740 camera.  Fixed payload size of Ipimb config.
2010-Jun-06 weaver	Tag V02-02-02.  Changed pds/encoder/pci3e_dev to clear_fifo on unconfigure to cleanup
			after a messy shutdown.  Added ENABLE bit to pci3e_dev configure to enable capture of
			encoder values.
2010-May-25 weaver	Changed PartitionControl delay for Disable to 0.2s (greater than camera shutter width).
			Changed EbTimeouts to be hierarchical to clarify where the timeout occurs.
			Added 10ms delay in ToEventWireScheduler between flush of L1A and Disable to
			alleviate coalescing of the two.
2010-Apr-27 weaver	evgr/EvrManager now reconfigures on BeginCalibCycle.  Changed acqiris/AcqManager
			to generate ClearReadout occurrence only once until cleared.
2010-Apr-14 weaver	Changed InDatagram/Datagram relationship to inheritance rather than contains.
			Protected EbBase from crashing on late L1Accepts (after Unmap).
2010-Mar-15 weaver	Tag V01-09-00.  Added traffic shaping to segment levels.
2010-Mar-12 weaver	Refactor pds/camera classes for FCCD implementation.
2009-Dec-03 tomytsai    Update epicsArch classes to skip missing PVs and report damage, and also limit on the number of 
      no-connection errors reported to the console (or log file)
2009-Dec-03 weaver  Tag V01-08-01.  Enabled select mask in the event builder.  Fixed data
      corruption associated with event builder "cache misses" (on split events).
      Tagged top-level xtc with IncompleteContribution damage when cache-miss chunk
      writes beyond end of xtc payload (rce only - last chunk size is not maximum).
2009-Nov-18 weaver  Tag V01-06-01.  Changed ObserverLevel to take a mask of event-level nodes to monitor.
2009-Nov-12 weaver  Fix to CameraManager to configure only on Configure (not BeginCalib yet).  Fix to 
      SegmentLevel and InletWireServer to properly dissolve/allocate the stream (handling
      the event builder inputs and stream outlet wires).  Change to XtcIterator::iterate()
      to jump current hierarchy level on receipt of -1 from process() (rather than just
      out of the entire hierarchy).
2009-Nov-10 weaver  Tag V01-06-00.  Segregated bld into a separate "segment-level" event builder.
2009-Nov-5  weaver  Added vmon histograms to bld event builder.  Fixed bug which prevented damage 0x8000 from
      sometimes propagating up.  Now, damage 0x8000 is marked on the incomplete contribution and
      damage 0x10000 is propagated up.  XtcIterator changed accordingly.
2009-Oct-28 weaver  Tag V01-05-00.  Removed Recorder level.  Fixed ControlStreams bug which caused damage 0x8000
      on Configure.
2009-Oct-8  cpo         Fix bug with run number allocation during automatic reconfig when changing config db.  Tagged V01-03-02.
2009-Oct-8  tomytsai    Add procInfo field into RceProxyMsg structure in rceProxy library
2009-Oct-8  weaver      Tag V01-04-00.  Evr retrieves opcode from configuration db.
      Changed event-builder to only use Sequence::fiducials() from BLD and no other Seq fields.
2009-Oct-7      caf     Version to support logbook entries and filename convention.  Tag V01-03-00.
2009-Sep-30     weaver/cpo Put in kludge to avoid corrupt xtc files where we don't do a fixup for dropped BLD contributions.
2009-Sep-29 tomytsai    Add rceProxy library
2009-Sep-29 weaver  Fixed segment level startup "race".  Protected against configuration TC buffer
            overflows.
2009-Sep-24 cpo Support for acqiris calibrations.  Also made outoforder damage persistent in acqiris until executable restarted.  Tag V01-02-00.
2009-Sep-11 weaver  Added payload to transitions from control level (for recording configuration).
            Capped printout from event-builders.
2009-Sep-10 tomytsai  Add Epics data collector level 1 (segment) node library in pds/epicsArch.

            removing groups from MonCds.
2009-Aug-18 weaver  Tag V01-01-00.  Added Waveform and Image classes to mon with no
            integrating options.
2009-Aug-15 weaver  Tag V01-00-03.  Removed MsgAppliance usage.  Adjusted Acqiris
            OutOfSync checking for master EVG rate tolerances and fiducial
            count rollover.
2009-Aug-12 weaver  Tag V01-00-02.  Added timeout for control level transitions.
2009-Aug-7  weaver  Fix bug when using procSrv where camera frame sizes are reduced.
2009-Jul-22 weaver  Tag V01-00-01.  Uses additional vectoring field in TimeStamp.
            Added qualifiers to PartitionControl transitions.
2009-Jul-14 weaver  Tag V01-00-00.  Consistent with pdsdata V00-05-00.  Added calibration
            cycles.  Added sequencing in the Evr (nevents or time).  Source levels
            now identify themselves by DetInfo to the ControlLevel during platform
            discovery.  Recorded transitions are broadcast (AllEvents, AllRecorders
            multicast group) to all nodes.
2009-Jul-13     cpo     Fix bug where AcqManager was putting the same task on the queue
                        when reconfiguring.
2009-Jul-10     cpo     Support for configuration of acqiris from database
2009-Jul-07 weaver  Fixed SysClk::sample rollover in VmonEb histos.  Fixed recorder level fixup
            that added contributions from all event levels.
2009-Jun-01 weaver  Tag V00-09-00.  Consistent with pdsdata V00-04-00.  Added management/PartitionControl
            as a base for run control sequencer.
2009-Apr-16 weaver  Added Pulnix TM6740 camera.  Added occurrences to collection messages.
            Added function to drop evr multicasts and generate opal1k out-of-order (for testing).
            Fix in GenericPoolW to use counting semaphore for pool resource counting.
            Fix in Event Builder to keep good events in order.  Individual (errant) events can slip
            out-of-order due to dropped contributions and missing PulseId.
            Added support for vmon archiving.
2009-Apr-3      cpo     Change some default acqiris params so that
                        we don't get as many "WARNING: Parameter has been
                        adapted" messages.  We still have one, which
                        comes when we set the trigger coupling to DC50ohms
                        (for some reason it complains that the previous
                        setting didn't have the 50 ohms in it, I believe).

2009-Mar-31     weaver  Tag V00-08-00.  Consistent with pdsdata V00-03-00.
            Added missing versions to all data type constructions.
            Added typedefs in config/*Type.hh to track current versions of config objects.
            Added vmon.
2009-Mar-24     cpo     Tag V00-07-03.  Better (final?) acqiris data support.
2009-Mar-20 weaver  Tag V00-07-02.  Added collection "Query" messages for source
            level management.  Implemented partition id/multicast group
            assignments in management/[Source,Control]Level,PartitionMember and EvrManager.
2009-Mar-10 weaver  Tag V00-07-01.  Minor fixes to camera code.
2009-Mar-04 weaver  Tag V00-07-00.  Many changes to camera interfaces.  Now reads
            configuration from database and writes record on configure transition.
            Added a simple insert() to InDatagram class for appending data to
            an existing datagram.
2009-Feb-19 weaver  Added mon package for online monitoring support classes.
2009-Feb-13     cpo     Improved AcqManager, including out-of-synch detection
                        of dropped triggers.  EvgrManager now works at 360Hz
                        and sends down timestamps much like we expect the
                        MCC EVG to do.

2009-Jan-29 weaver  client/Fsm handles unmap/deallocate.  Added a default Sequeunce
            for L1 data that doesn't get one from an evr match.
2009-Jan-28 weaver  Tag V00-06-01.  zerocopy/dma_splice can now queue sparsely and
            share "release arguments" across many queued buffers.
            camera/DmaSplice,Frame,TwoDMoments added to support camera
            feature extraction.  xtc/PayloadIterator added; CDatagramIterator
            inherits from it.
2009-Jan-13 weaver  Tag V00-06-00.  Many changes to zero-copy eb including new
            dma_splice kernel module.
2008-Dec-19     cpo     Changes to evgr to support opcodes with rates
                        of 1,5,10,15,30,60,120,240Hz.  Also fix
                        for acqiris "Flags has been modified" warning and
                        bugs in Fsm.
2008-Nov-14     cpo     Tag V00-05-00.  Many changes to support exporting data to offline.
2008-Oct-28 weaver  Tag V00-04-00.  Fixed EbKey/Server dependencies.  Renamed InXtc->Xtc.
2008-Oct-27     cpo     Tag V00-03-01.  Forgot to add AcqServer files and
                        DmaEngine in utility.
2008-Oct-27     cpo     Tag V00-03-00.  Add support for evg/evr/acqiris.

            network buffering.
2008-Oct-15 weaver  Tag V00-02-01.  Many fixes and changes for platform model.
2008-Oct-10 weaver  Tag V00-02-00.  Collection added platforms.  First commit
            of zero-copy event builders.  Also added zerocopy/tub as
            a buffer between pipes.
2008-Sep 24 weaver  Tag V00-01-00.  Many changes to event builders and levels.
2008-Sep-12 weaver  Initial import of utility, xtc, client, management code.
2008-Sep-09 weaver  Tag V00-00-00.  Initial import of service and collection code.
